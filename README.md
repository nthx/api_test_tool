api test tool
=============

Acceptance Testing support for your API. Implementation agnostic. Written in Ruby. For Ruby.

When you refactor or even change *entire* software stack - you won't worry your app breaks 

* tests your public API only (black box testing)
* based on Plain Old Testing: prepare, execute, assert
* doesn't matter if it's REST, XML, JSON as soon as response is ascii based
* leverages Ruby Rspec tests you already know

This is a console tool based on Ruby. No GUI.
